## About

This library provides:

1. `BufferPool`: A pool for re-using byte slices of varied sizes. This pool will always return a slice with at least the size requested and a capacity up to the next power of two. Each size class is pooled independently which makes the `BufferPool` more space efficient than a plain `sync.Pool` when used in situations where data size may vary over an arbitrary range. 
2. `Buffer`: a buffer compatible with `bytes.Buffer` but backed by a `BufferPool`. Unlike `bytes.Buffer`, `Buffer` will automatically "shrink" on read, using the buffer pool to avoid causing too much work for the allocator. This is primarily useful for long lived buffers that usually sit empty.

### Advantages over GC

* Reduces Memory Usage:
  * We don't have to wait for a GC to run before we can reuse memory. This is essential if you're repeatedly allocating large short-lived buffers.

* Reduces CPU usage:
  * It takes some load off of the GC (due to buffer reuse).
  * We don't have to zero buffers (fewer wasteful memory writes).

### Disadvantages over GC:

* Can leak memory contents. Unlike the go GC, we *don't* zero memory.
* All buffers have a capacity of a power of 2. This is fine if you either expect these buffers to be temporary or you need buffers of this size.
* Requires that buffers be explicitly put back into the pool. This can lead to race conditions and memory corruption if the buffer is released while it's still in use.
